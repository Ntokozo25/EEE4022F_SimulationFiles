# Intelligent Energy Management System for a Hybrid Microgrid with Renewables and Battery Storage

Fuzzy Logic Controller IEMS is demonstrated in the "HybridMicrogrid_FuzzyLogic.slx" model


## Getting Started
To run this demo:
1. Extract the files to a directory and navigate to that folder in MATLAB
2. Open the "HybridMicrogrid_FuzzyLogic.slx" model. This model should automatically "initialConditions" file.
3. Run the initialConditions to load all the data.
4. Run the simulink file to simulate the microgrid and FLC

## Toolbox Requirements
- MATLAB
- Controls Toolbox
